# Project Euler Repository

This repository contains my solutions to the problems from Project Euler. Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems that require creative problem-solving skills. Each problem is designed to be solved using programming and mathematical techniques.

## Problem Solving Approach

I have approached the problems in a systematic and organised manner, striving for efficient and optimised solutions. Here's how I have structured my code and solutions:

1. **Problem Description**: Each solution is accompanied by a brief description of the problem statement from Project Euler. This provides context for the solution and helps understand the problem requirements.

2. **Solution Code**: I have provided the solution code written in JavaScript where possble and aim to expand at a later date

3. **Explanation**: Along with the code, I have included explanations of the approach and algorithm used to solve the problem. These explanatios and comments break down the problem into smaller steps and clarifies the logic behind the solution.

4. **Input and Output**: If applicable, I have mentioned the expected input format and provided sample inputs and outputs to demonstrate the correctness of the solution.

5. **Efficiency and Optimisation**: Whenever possible, I have focused on optimising the code to achieve the most efficient solution. This includes analysing the time and space complexity of the algorithm used and discussing any improvements or alternative approaches.

## Organisation

The repository is structured as follows:

- Each problem has its own folder, named according to the problem number (Based on the FreeCodeCamp organisation).

- Inside each folder, you will find the solution code file, README.md file explaining the problem and any additional resources or files necessary for the solution.

- The solutions are organised in ascending order, starting from problem 1 and continuing through the higher problem numbers.
